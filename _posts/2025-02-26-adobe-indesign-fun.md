While taking an Introduction to Digital Media course, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into the features of Adobe InDesign, an industry-standard tool for design and digital publishing. The course offered hands-on experience with a variety of creative tools, and one of the first assignments was to create a short, dynamic slideshow that incorporated multiple features of InDesign, such as animation, embedded video, and interactive links.

In a short period, I was able to harness the power of these tools to produce a polished and engaging project. The process involved using animation techniques to bring elements to life, incorporating video clips to enhance the narrative, and embedding interactive links to create a seamless and interactive viewer experience. This project allowed me to gain practical skills in digital media design and further explore the versatility of Adobe InDesign as both a layout and interactive design platform.
